Data Handover folder contains the whole researched data, slides and code files for this research course.
Below you can find the details of each file:

Algorithm.pptx (file contains the slides for Convolutional Neural Network and Back Propagation. It also include the code slides of Back Propagation. In the slides you can find the detail introduction and mathematics behind these algorithms)

Backpropagation.py (file contains the python code to perform backpropagation on simple AND gate network. For code you need Python 3.6, math, string, random, Jupyter notebook and Anaconda)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).pptx (file contains the slides for the GAN algorithm in detail. At the end you can find the small example for GAN algorithm which generate Guassian data)

Guassian_data_Genration_with_GAN.py (file contains the python code to run GAN algorithm to generate Gaussian distribution. For code you need Python 3.6, py.torch, numpy, pyplot, variables, Jupyter notebook and Anaconda)
